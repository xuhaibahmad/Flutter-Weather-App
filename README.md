## About

A minimalist weather app built as part of a portfolio item. The main purpose of this project is to learn Flutter and apply best practices to it. While the app is functional, it should only be used as a reference project.

## Getting Started

The project uses [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) API, you will need to get your own key and store it inside `secrets.json` file inside the `assets` directory. Here's an example of what the file should look like:

```
{
    "OpenWeatherApiKey": "Your Key"
}
```

## Contributing

PRs and Issues are always welcomed.
